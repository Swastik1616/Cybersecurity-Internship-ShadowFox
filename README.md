# Cybersecurity-Internship-ShadowFox
This repository is the PoW of my One-month Virtual CyberSecurity internship at ShadowFox.

During this one-month internship, I was assigned tasks categorized into Beginner, Intermediate & Advanced Levels.

▶️ As the name suggests, the beginner-level tasks were quite easy to do. I had to perform port scanning, directory fuzzing, and traffic interception on the given target website.

▶️ For the Intermediate level, I had to decrypt a hashed password and use it to access a provided encrypted VeraCrypt File. Next, I had to find the address of the entry point using the PE Explorer Tool. The last task of this level was to gain reverse shell access to a Windows 10 machine, which I did using Metasploit Framework in my Kali Linux.

▶️ Coming to the Advanced Level, all tasks of a pentesting room from TryHackMe were to be completed.

Lastly, It was not just about completing the tasks; the main challenge according to me was - REPORT WRITING. I got the opportunity to learn how Professional, Industry-Level Penetration testing reports are written. 
⭐ Fixed format and concise writing were what they were seeking. ⭐
